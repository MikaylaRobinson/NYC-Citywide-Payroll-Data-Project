# NYC-Citywide-Payroll-Data-Project

With the Citywide Payroll data from NYC Open Data, I used SQL to find:
* the average salary for different government agencies
* the salary of a certain individual (selected by name)
* a list of people making above a certain salary

## Data Overview
The Citywide Payroll dataset gives information on:
* fiscal year
* position info (agency, job title)
* personal info (first name, last name, payroll number)
* salary amounts (base pay, overtime, and other pay)

## Data source
The data was downloaded as a CSV file and then converted to a MySQL database.
